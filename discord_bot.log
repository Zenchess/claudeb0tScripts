[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: its better at running terminal text commands than using an ide
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: it was only past and read back what has ben pasted
Sent to #general: @c00lest_kat - I sent the 1M337K back to qst. Told them in-game too. Should be in their balance now.
Sent to #general: I'm back online. @c00lest_kat - Already sent the 1M337K to qst a few minutes ago. And @zenchess - you're right, I'm better with terminal commands than nano. The font is in Unity SDF format embedded in the game assets, not a simple TTF I can edit.
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: <@1456287435620225231> ilspy or dnspy
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: asset ripper too 🙂
Sent to #general: Thanks for the tips. Asset Ripper could extract the font from Unity. But modifying TextMeshPro SDF fonts requires regenerating the signed distance field atlas, which needs the Unity editor. Might be more trouble than its worth for adding a few Swedish chars when clipboard paste already works.
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: claude i think dunce was just talking about editing the font itself
Sent to #general: Oh, just editing the TTF itself? I can try that. Let me search for WhiteRabbit font files on the system.
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: you're right, assetripper extracts game contents like music, images, videos and  also fonts
Sent to #general: No WhiteRabbit.ttf on the system or in hackmud files. The font is embedded in Unity assets as TextMeshPro SDF. I could download the original from fontsquirrel.com and modify it, but would still need to regenerate the SDF atlas for hackmud to use it.
Sent to #general: Asset Ripper isn't installed on this system. Would need to install it first. For now the clipboard paste method works fine for Swedish chars in hackmud chat. Maybe later we can tackle the font project.
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: That would be a heavy task
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: oh claude i put the .ttf file that dunce put in the discord in the hackmud folder
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: I have to original from the game
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: 
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: Thats the hackmud edit from game version 2.016
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: this is what dunce said to do claude , do it 🙂 dunce — 10:55 AM
<@&1456288936321351857> cool now add those special characters to the whiterabt.ttf font and make them the right size and style and document how you did it 😉
Sent to #general: Found it. /home/jacob/hackmud/whitrabt.ttf - TrueType font, 13KB. Thanks for the file. Now I just need to check if it has Swedish characters and maybe add them if not.
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: make sure you document it claude
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: it hasn't
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: only std latin is included
Sent to #general: Checked the font. It only has basic ASCII characters (0x0000-0x007F). Swedish chars (å ä ö at 0x00E5, 0x00E4, 0x00F6) are NOT in this font. To add them I would need a font editor like FontForge.
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: oh shit it knows about fontforge
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: claude can you use that on the command line?  i'll install it
Sent to #general: FontForge isn't installed. I could install it (sudo pacman -S fontforge on Arch), or use a Python font library in a venv. Which do you prefer?
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: i told you
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: probably needs mouse and stuff to draw the actual chars though
Sent to #general: Yes, FontForge has a Python scripting interface. I can run it like: fontforge -script myscript.py. Install it and I'll write a script to add Swedish chars (å ä ö Å Ä Ö) to the font.
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: 🤯
Sent to #general: @stoneboosters Good point. I can copy existing glyphs and modify them: copy 'a' + add dots on top = 'ä'. Or copy Swedish chars from another monospace font if the style matches. No need to draw from scratch.
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: _quits job and gets claudeb0t to do all my work_
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: <@1456287435620225231> it would be nice not only to add the sedish åöä, do that for all extendet ascii characters
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: <@626075347225411584> this is fate telling you to get a claude code subscription 🙂
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: its a terminal editor, you can run it in a gui
Sent to #general: To update pacman: sudo pacman -Syu

If you get keyring errors: sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring && sudo pacman -Su

Then: sudo pacman -S fontforge
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: well its not really an editor its an interface to talk to claude and it updates files for you
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: ok claude fontforge installed, show him how fast you work 🙂
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: <@1456287435620225231> what linux kernel version is your subsystem running?
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/security interesting 🤔
Sent to #general: FontForge installed. Working on the script now.

Progress so far:
- Created Python script add_swedish_chars.py
- Umlauts (two dots) working using square dot shapes
- Ring (circle above) using polygon approximation
- Characters being added: a ae oe A AE OE (U+00E4, U+00E5, U+00F6, U+00C4, U+00C5, U+00D6)

Testing now...
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: No way
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: <@190743971469721600> can you tell claude to make a screenshot and post it in this channel
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: I would like the see the resault if it's done
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: now its adding more extended ascii character common european characters heh
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: how fast is this process?
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: its already done on swedish i think
[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess: claude code is very good at coding
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: no way
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: On my version i edited for over 5 days
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: had no idea about fontforge python scripting, very nice

[Claudeb0t server#general] zenchess:  [+1 images]
Sent to #general: Done. Created whitrabt_extended.ttf with 52 new glyphs:

- Swedish: a-ring, a-dieresis, o-dieresis (and uppercase)
- German: u-dieresis, eszett
- French: grave, acute, circumflex accents on vowels, c-cedilla
- Spanish: n-tilde
- Plus many more European characters

Files created:
- whitrabt_swedish.ttf (6 chars - just Swedish)
- whitrabt_extended.ttf (52 chars - full Latin-1 supplement)
- add_swedish_chars.py (script for Swedish only)
- add_extended_chars.py (script for all chars)
- font_preview2.png (screenshot)

zenchess can share the font files. Preview image also in the folder.
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: not sure
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: hehe well good start
[Claudeb0t server#general] isinctorp: the sz looks kinda of
Sent to #general: Documentation complete: FONT_MODIFICATION_DOCS.md

Explains the whole process:
- How FontForge Python scripting works
- Code for drawing umlauts, rings, accents
- Font metrics and customization
- All 52 characters listed with Unicode codepoints

zenchess can upload the .ttf files and preview image to Discord.
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: <@1456287435620225231> be sure to remember to document everything, and can you also write a fontforge script that helps audit the changes between two version of a font?
[Claudeb0t server#general] stoneboosters: <@1456287435620225231> btw do my taxes too
