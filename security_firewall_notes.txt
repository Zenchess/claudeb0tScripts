# Security.firewall Challenge Notes
# Started: 2026-01-01

## What I know so far:
- security.firewall is likely a defensive/challenge script in hackmud
- I need to figure out how to "beat" it

## Attempts:

### Attempt 1: Initial exploration (05:29)
Running security.firewall{} returns a large grid of seemingly random characters.

First few lines:
Sr0{FVH%_DOJgx7cBeZH4)5h
s]!#q!Ei5O+k41tD*LEwlvR+
om(Gza!}sToV&DO[tQdimlf(
qTaudISKYDM+B5{CCW8@vpBq

This looks like either:
1. A scrambled message/cipher to decode
2. ASCII art with a hidden message
3. Some kind of pattern to find

Let me try different approaches...

### Web research hints:
From hackmud forums, there are riddle-based challenges:
1. "Feed your password and it lives, yet give it a drink and it dies" = FIRE
2. "Your password is a house. One enters it blind and comes out seeing" = SCHOOL

### User hint: Colors in security.firewall are same as script parameters
This means colored text in the grid might spell out parameter names/values.

### Attempt 2: Try passing arguments (05:30)
Tried security.firewall{password:"fire"} - just returned another grid
Tried security.firewall{answer:"fire"} - same result

The firewall seems to just generate random character grids.

### Observation:
The grids change each time I call security.firewall.
The user mentioned colors are important - but the JSON response strips color codes.
Maybe I need to look at the actual game screen to see colored letters.

### Attempt 3: Looking for hidden words (05:31)
The JSON response strips color codes. The user says colors are like script parameters.
In hackmud, script parameters use backtick codes like `N for blue.

Each call to security.firewall returns a DIFFERENT grid - it's randomized!
This means it's likely a word search where I need to find a colored word.

Since I can't see colors in JSON, I should look for patterns or common words.
Looking at a sample grid row: "Sr0{FVH%_DOJgx7cBeZH4)5h"
The characters include letters, numbers, and symbols.

Possible approaches:
1. Look for horizontal/vertical/diagonal words
2. The colored letters might spell out a word
3. Try common passwords like "fire", "school", "password"

### Attempt 4: Try more password guesses (05:32)
Tried security.firewall{school:"test"} - still returns a grid, no error message

Observation: Every call returns a NEW random grid. No success/failure indication.
The parameter I pass doesn't seem to change the behavior.

### Current Theory:
The firewall displays a word search grid on screen.
Some letters are COLORED to spell out a word.
I need to find that colored word in the GAME SCREEN (not JSON).
Then pass that word as a parameter.

The colors are like script parameter colors:
- `N = blue (parameter names)
- `0 = gray
- `C = cyan
- etc.

### Next Steps:
1. Need to view the actual game screen to see colors
2. Or write a script to parse the grid for patterns
3. Or ask other players for hints

### Summary of what I've learned:
- security.firewall returns a character grid (word search style)
- Grid changes every call
- Need to find colored letters that spell a word
- That word is likely the password/answer to pass back

### Attempt 5: Analysis script (05:41)
Created fw_analyze script to check for special characters in response.
Result: 0 special characters found - colors are NOT in JSON response!
- 187 lines, 4674 chars, 3007 letters
- Colors are only visible on the actual game screen

### Current Block:
I cannot see the actual game screen to identify which letters are colored.
The JSON response strips all color codes.
Need player help to see which letters are highlighted.

### Memory Scanner Updates (05:50):
- Updated mem_scanner.py to capture backtick color codes (`N, `C, etc.)
- Added logging for raw colored output
- Scanner captures chat messages with colors but not the firewall grid
- The firewall grid colors seem to be added during Unity rendering, not in the data

### What I've learned from web research:
1. The firewall displays TWO colored words in the grid
2. One word is the parameter NAME (like "pass" or another key)
3. One word is the VALUE
4. You pass them as `key:"value"` to the firewall
5. Colors match script parameter colors:
   - Cyan (`N) = parameter names
   - Magenta/pink = parameter values
6. Example from VLAN: riddle answers like "fire", "school", "promise"

### Need from user:
Can you look at your game screen and tell me what colored letters you see
when you run security.firewall{}? I need to know:
1. What color are they?
2. What word do they spell out?

There should be TWO colored words - one for the key and one for the value.
